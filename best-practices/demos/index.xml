The demo will show the following
Automated triggering of Network Service or VNF build from a Git project source change. Creation of a pre-production environment and all VNF or test dependencies required to run the updated Network Service. Automated behaviour testing of the updated Network Service On success the network service binary package is built with an appropriate version number and stored in Nexus Pre-requisites Have read the CI/CD Hub Introduction Working CI/CD Hub and ALM environment Install local LMCTL Working Docker Environment to run VNFs Installing the Demo Clone the Agile Lifecycle Manager (ALM) demo artifacts from GitHub to your local machine</description></item></channel></rss>
