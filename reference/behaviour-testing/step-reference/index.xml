For example, this step could be used to check a scale occurred on an Assembly when simulating traffic that triggers a scale policy.
The step begins monitoring Kafka as the step is executed, so any processes completed before then will not be seen.
Passes when:
a message is seen which describes the success of the given process for the given Assembly Fails when:</description></item><item><title>Intent Engine</title><link>https://pages.github.ibm.com/TNC/alm-docs.github.io/reference/behaviour-testing/step-reference/intent-engine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.github.ibm.com/TNC/alm-docs.github.io/reference/behaviour-testing/step-reference/intent-engine/</guid><description>Create Assembly Description Requests the creation of an Assembly with the given descriptor and initial state. The step then waits for the process to complete successfully.

The difference between these steps and those in the Intent Engine group is the asynchronous execution. These steps only request the process to start, they do not wait for it to complete. The successful completion of the process can be checked for later in the scenario with the provided &amp;ldquo;Expect Intent Success&amp;rdquo; step.
Create Assembly Description Requests the creation of an Assembly with the given descriptor and initial state, progressing when the request is accepted.</description></item><item><title>Metric Definitions</title><link>https://pages.github.ibm.com/TNC/alm-docs.github.io/reference/behaviour-testing/step-reference/metric-definitions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.github.ibm.com/TNC/alm-docs.github.io/reference/behaviour-testing/step-reference/metric-definitions/</guid><description>Specify Metric Definition Description Specify the format of messages on Kafka for a metric type that will be recorded later.

You must create a metric definition before recording metrics, as this informs the monitor how to identify the Resource and metric type for each message.
Recording stops when explicitly requested with the Stop Recording step or when the scenario finishes.
Passes when:
the recording has started Fails when:</description></item><item><title>Metric Assertions</title><link>https://pages.github.ibm.com/TNC/alm-docs.github.io/reference/behaviour-testing/step-reference/metric-assertions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.github.ibm.com/TNC/alm-docs.github.io/reference/behaviour-testing/step-reference/metric-assertions/</guid><description>Verify always under threshold Description Checks that all values seen whilst recording a metric are under a given value.
