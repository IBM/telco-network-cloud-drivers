It is based around the state model of Telco Network Cloud Orchestration (TNC-O)
Associated with each definition are details of the request parameters and responses. These include the name of each field plus a brief description and whether the field is mandatory. Whether a field is required or not is based on the context of the examples. The underlying API definition may mark a field as optional, but in some contexts, the fields must be supplied.</description></item><item><title>Descriptors</title><link>https://ibm.github.io/telco-network-cloud-drivers/reference/lm-api/api-definition/topology/catalog-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ibm.github.io/telco-network-cloud-drivers/reference/lm-api/api-definition/topology/catalog-api/</guid><description>The following details the API to manage descriptors within TNC-O. Assembly descriptors can be added, listed, updated and deleted. Resource descriptors can be listed and deleted but can only be added or updated through the Resource Manager API.
