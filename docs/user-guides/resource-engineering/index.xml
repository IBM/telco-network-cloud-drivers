Resource instances ultimately represent infrastructure and the software running at a location to fulfil a function.
Telco Network Cloud Orchestration (TNC-O) requires a descriptor to identify the properties, transitions, operations, metrics, and the infrastructure available for each resource instance. The Resource can then be added to any number of Assembly designs and instantiated upon creation of an Assembly.</description></item></channel></rss>
