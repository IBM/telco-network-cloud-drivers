# Behaviour Testing

Behaviour testing allows you to simulate scenarios that will test the lifecycle of your VNFs/Network Services. It allows you to automate creating instances of your services in test environments, simulating traffic or lifecycle processes, whilst monitoring and asserting metric values are as expected. 

Each scenario can be executed independently to confirm a particular aspect or feature of your service is working. The full collection of the scenarios related to a service can also be executed as a test suite, useful in a CI/CD process to re-test the service after a change has been made. 

To begin using the behaviour testing feature of the Agile Lifecycle Manager (ALM) open one of your Assembly designs and click on the "Behaviour Testing" tab at the bottom of the design.

In this screen you will see the three main aspects of behaviour testing:

- Assembly Configurations - planned Assemblies to use in scenarios
- Scenarios - test scripts executed to simulate situations to confirm the behaviour of your Assemblies
- Results - results of each execution of a scenario for analysis
