# Structure

The structure of a resource package is determined by the resource manager that uses it. For Brent, see [Brent Resource Packages](/user-guides/resource-engineering/resource-packages/brent/create-brent-resource-package).

# Next Steps

Once you understand the basics of a Resource package, you may move on to understand [Drivers](/user-guides/resource-engineering/drivers/overview) and how they are used by Brent to manage the Resource.
