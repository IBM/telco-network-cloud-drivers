# Sizing guideline for ICP

This guideline is for hardware requirements of installing Lifecycle Manager on top of [IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.1.0/getting_started/introduction.html)

Then, download the Telco Network Cloud Orchestration (TNC-O) sizing guideline from the attachment of this page. You will need Microsoft Excel to open this file.

Put your ICP cluster hardware details, and the desired number of resources you plan for TNC-O (assuming standard daily lifecycle actions). Make sure there's enough hardware resources for your case.
