While orchestrating Assemblies, LM leverages a set of one or more external Resource Managers (RM) through their northbound APIs to orchestrate the lifecycles of the managed resource instances deployed to Virtual Infrastructure Managers (VIMs). The Resource Managers are responsible for communicating with VIMs to request actions on cloud infrastructure compute, storage and network resources in support of deployed resource instances lifecycles.</description></item></channel></rss>
